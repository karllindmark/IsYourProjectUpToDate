More to come in the future, so... stay tuned! :-)

# Special Thanks
Oh, and I almost forgot - I'd like to thank <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">the Jetbrains team</a> for the open source license of Pycharm - I wouldn't probably have managed without <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/whatsnew">their awesome IDE</a>!
